### Description
Guess the randomly generated number, using as less attempts as possible.

### What's the case?
Write the programm, capable of guessing numbers

**What's the challenge:**
- Computer randomly generates an integer number from 0 to 100, that we have to guess. Guess means - write the programm which will do this for us.
- An algorithm takes in consideration if number is less or bigger than target.

**Quality metrics**
The results are measured by mean quality for 1000 attempts.

**Practicing**
Good Python coding
